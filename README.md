üìä Statistical Data Analysis on Titanic Dataset Using Python üö¢

In this project, I conducted an in-depth statistical data analysis on the Titanic dataset from Kaggle, leveraging Python and its powerful libraries. Here‚Äôs a step-by-step breakdown of the process:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Collection & Preprocessing
Downloaded

the dataset from Kaggle and uploaded it into VS Code.Explored the data, handled missing values, and dropped unnecessary columns for cleaner analysis.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Manipulation & Statistical Analysis

Utilized Pandas and NumPy for efficient data handling and analysis.
Conducted descriptive statistics to understand key insights, such as fare distribution based on gender.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Data Visualization

Used Matplotlib and Seaborn to create box plots, histograms, and heatmaps, revealing trends and correlations.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Hypothesis Testing & Statistical Methods

Performed Chi-square tests, T-tests, and Normality tests to validate assumptions.

Compared two independent variables to extract meaningful insights.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Predictive Modeling

Built a Simple Linear Regression model to predict fare based on age, demonstrating the power of statistical modeling.

This project provided valuable hands-on experience in data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), hypothesis testing, and predictive modeling, which are essential skills for a data analyst.
